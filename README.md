# Deutsche Welle Website Analysis: Graph Mining Perspective

#### 1. Summarize and Interpret the Achieved Results

The primary results of the analysis indicate that sophisticated machine learning models like Random Forest can predict links between regions and categories in the DW news dataset with high accuracy (92%). However, the baseline model using a simple heuristic, performed poorly, showing that the relationships between regions and categories are too complex for simple methods.

#### 2. Compare Results to Expected Outcomes

In the original plan, the aim was to test the hypothesis that DW provides unbiased news coverage across regions and categories. The high performance of the predictive models supports this hypothesis, indicating systematic and predictable patterns in news coverage. This aligns with the expected outcome that DW presents comprehensive and unbiased news coverage.

#### 3. Explain the Generated Value

The analysis and prediction algorithms help the organization by:

- **Validating Coverage Patterns**: Confirming that DWâ€™s news coverage follows systematic patterns and is not random.
- **Identifying Key Categories and Regions**: Highlighting the significant role of categories like Politics and Conflicts and the prominent mention of regions like Germany. Those are highly connected nodes and create links to others.
- **Improving Content Strategy**: Helping DW strategize content to ensure balanced and comprehensive coverage across all regions and categories.

#### 4. Recommend Course of Action

Based on the results, DW should:

- **Maintain Balanced Coverage**: Continue to ensure a balanced representation of regions and categories, particularly in key areas like Politics and Conflicts.
- **Expand Analysis**: Extend the analysis to other attributes such as Text, Related Topics, and Summary to get a deeper understanding of coverage patterns.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor coverage patterns and adjust strategies to address any emerging biases or gaps.

#### 5. Reflect on Limitations and Possible Pitfalls

- **Limited Attributes**: The analysis focused only on Region and Category attributes, which might not capture the full complexity of news coverage.
- **Bias in Data**: The period of dataset selected is between end of 2023 to start of 2024 that may introduce over-representation of certain regions or categories than others. Secondly, the selection of subgraph based on threshold value may introduce biasness. 
- **Model Limitations**: While the models performed well, they might still miss subtle biases or trends not captured in the current features.

#### 6. Critically Discuss Methodology

- **Graphing**: Using the NetworkX is an essential tool to examine the given dataset.
- **Graph Properties**: Analyzing the Centrality measurement help to understand the behavior of network sturcture. Especially highlighting the strong centrality and connections of Politics, Conflict, and Germany.
- **Node2Vec Embeddings**: Using Node2Vec was appropriate for capturing complex relationships in the graph. However, exploring other graph embedding techniques might provide additional insights.
- **Feature Selection**: The choice of features was limited to node pairs. Including more contextual features from the articles could enhance model performance.
- **Model Choices**: While Random Forest and Logistic Regression were effective, experimenting with other advanced models like Graph Neural Networks could potentially yield better results.
- **Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning**: This was a good choice, but a more exhaustive search or alternative tuning techniques could further optimize model performance.

#### 7. Propose Ideas for Future Work

- **Incorporate Text Analysis**: Analyze the content of the articles (e.g., sentiment analysis, topic modeling) to understand the tone and themes associated with different regions and categories.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examine how the coverage of regions and categories evolves over time to identify trends and shifts in focus.
- **Extend Attribute Set**: Include additional attributes like Related Topics and Summary to provide a more comprehensive analysis.
- **Bias Detection**: Develop methods to detect and quantify potential biases in news coverage to ensure more balanced reporting.

By addressing these areas, future analyses can provide deeper insights and further validate DW's commitment to unbiased and comprehensive news coverage.
